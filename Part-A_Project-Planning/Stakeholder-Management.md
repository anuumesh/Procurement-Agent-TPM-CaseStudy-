# Stakeholder Management Strategy

## Engagement Model

The Procurement Agent program involves multiple government entities with different operational priorities. A structured engagement framework has been designed to ensure alignment without slowing delivery execution.

---

## Communication Framework

| Stakeholder Group | Engagement Frequency | Format |
--------------------------------------------
Department of Procurement | Weekly | Steering Review
Department of Finance | Bi-weekly | Integration Sync
AI Factory Leadership | Weekly | Executive Dashboard
Legal & Compliance | Weekly | Risk Review Session
Delivery Teams | Daily | Agile Standups

## Anticipated Stakeholder Conflicts

### Procurement vs Finance

Issue:  
Business teams prioritize speed of execution while finance teams prioritize audit traceability.

Resolution Approach:  
A dual-approval workflow will be implemented where automation accelerates processing while maintaining mandatory compliance checkpoints.

---

### Delivery Teams vs Business Stakeholders

Issue:  
Continuous feature expansion requests may impact delivery timelines.

Resolution Approach:  
All scope changes will be routed through a formal Change Control Board (CCB) chaired by AI Factory leadership.

## Change Management Process

1. Formal change request submission  
2. Impact analysis covering timeline, cost, security  
3. Steering Committee review  
4. Backlog reprioritization  
5. Stakeholder communication update  

This process ensures delivery stability while maintaining flexibility for high-value enhancements.
